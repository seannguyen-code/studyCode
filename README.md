# studyCode

> A curated collection of web development, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and full-stack practice projects. This repository is designed for learning, experimenting, and mastering modern web technologies through hands-on examples and mini-apps.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main folders, each focusing on different technologies and concepts:

- **coderX_old/**: Early web development exercises, including AJAX, DOM events, CSS layouts, and basic React demos.
- **javascript/**: JavaScript practice projects, including DOM manipulation, FabricJS, KonvaJS, and React-Konva canvas experiments.
- **practiceWeb/**: Full-stack and backend-focused projects, such as MERN shopping list and exercise tracker apps, plus random code snippets and SASS demos.
- **udemy/**: Projects and exercises inspired by Udemy courses, including calculators, Evernote clones, Firebase login, and advanced React patterns.

## Getting Started

Most projects are self-contained. To run a specific project:

1. Navigate to the project folder (e.g., `cd coderX_old/react/counter`).
2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
	```sh
	npm install
	```
3. Start the development server:
	```sh
	npm start
	```
4. For backend projects, follow instructions in their respective README files.

## Highlights

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Canvas (FabricJS, KonvaJS)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (MERN stack)
- **Full-stack**: Complete apps with both client and server code
- **Mini-projects**: Useful for interview prep, learning new libraries, and experimenting with UI/UX
